Following the snake game, I decided to tackle a more challenging game to develop, and Tetris is it. The game is also written in Java and utilizes the Swings library for the GUI. A significant difference between the snake and Tetris games is that the division of concerns should be much better. <br>
<br>**Commands**<br>
:arrow_left: - Move the Tetromino to the left <br>
:arrow_right: - Move the Tetromino to the right <br>
:arrow_down: - Move the Tetromino downwards <br>
:arrow_up: - Rotate the Tetromino 90&deg; clockwise <br>
:zero: - Exit in the middle of the game (initially added for debugging purposes) <br>
Space Bar - Hold the current Tetromino and activate the next one <br>
